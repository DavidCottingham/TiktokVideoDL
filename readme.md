#Tiktok Video Downloader

Provide a Tiktok share URL (vm.tiktok.com) or mobile site url (m.toktok.com) to download the video.
URLs can be provided in a text file list (one URL per line) with the -f command line argument, a single URL with the -u command line argument, or not providing either will prompt the user to enter a single URL after executing the script.
The -d command line argument will allow the user to specify a download location. Not providing this will download the video to the [home directory]/Videos/TikTok folder by default.
